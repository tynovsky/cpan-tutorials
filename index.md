# CPAN Tutorials

The CPAN allows you to easily download, install and use Perl
software packages on your system. The software package is called a
*distribution* and contains a Perl application or library.

The CPAN distributions can be used to extend or modify functionality in Perl
applications. Commonly, they're used to distribute reusable functionality that
is shared with other Perl programmers for use in their applications and
libraries.  Some distributions provide command line utilities to automate tasks
and speed up your work.
